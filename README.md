# BlogPreviewCard

This project was generated with Angular-CLI and Tailwind-CSS. In Tailwind-CSS, I done the styling layout using "flex". I implemented the title hovering logic using TypeScript. I have attached live website and working flow screenshots at this repository.

# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
